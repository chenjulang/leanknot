This repository holds some formalizations of knot theory proofs in lean.

Currently planning on:

- [x] underlying representation of bricks/walls [basic]
- [x] definition of tangle [tangle]
- [-] notion of planar isotopy equivalence [basic]
- [-] notion of reidemeister move equivalence [basic]
- [ ] inductive notion of tangle equivalency (TODO)
- [x] proof of tangle invariance across notions of equivalence [tangle]
- [x] definition of link [link]
- [ ] definition of knot

Not quite sure about the following:

- [ ] notion of tri-colourability
- [ ] notion of alternating
- [ ] HOMFLY/Jones polynomials
- [ ] braids
